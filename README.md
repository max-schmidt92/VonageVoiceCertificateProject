# Vonage

Hi Mark,

Thank you for your presentation today, I really enjoyed it!

To install this project, please perform the following steps:

1. Clone or download the project (e.g. git clone https://github.com/max-schmidt92/VonageVoiceOnlineSessionCertificationProject.git)
2. Open command prompt (or equivalent), change directory to the project's directory and type in "npm install".
   This will install all NodeJS packages necessary to run the project.
3. Change API key, API Secret and utilise your own projects private.key (put it directly in the same folder)
3. From the command prompt, type in "ngrok http 3000" or any port you like (if you use another port, change the variable in the Javascript file).
4. Enter your Nexmo dashboard, access your project you would like to use and enter the ngrok url as shown in the red boxes below:

4. Run or debug the project.

I have left all the credentials in file itself to simplify the installation process (except Nexmo credentials).
The Microsoft services is the free trial service, which you can use as much as you like.
The Teneo instance is our own internal instance for presales purposes.

I have also left a little transcript you can use to communicate with CarryMe, which is a conversational AI implementation for booking flights just for fun :)

Finally, if you have any questions about the project, the Teneo platform or anything else, feel free to contact me at max.topsholm@artificial-solutions.com.

Best regards,

Max Topsholm
